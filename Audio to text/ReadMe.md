# Speech Recognition Script

This Python script demonstrates how to perform speech recognition using the SpeechRecognition library. It allows you to input speech through your microphone and converts it into text.

## Description

The script utilizes the `speech_recognition` library to capture audio from the microphone, then utilizes Google's Speech Recognition service to convert the audio into text. If the speech is recognized successfully, it prints the recognized text. Otherwise, it handles potential errors such as unrecognized audio or issues with the recognition service.
